# Smart Dog Access

Smart Dog Access is a technologically advanced solution designed to provide a secure and convenient access point for dogs while preventing unauthorized access. By utilizing RFID chips embedded in dog collars, the system can verify the identity of the dogs and grant access only to authorized pets.

## Features

- RFID-based authentication: The system uses RFID technology to validate the dogs and grant access. Each dog collar contains a unique RFID chip associated with a specific pet.
- Secure and robust design: The system is designed to withstand external tampering and ensure the safety of the pets inside.
- ESP32 microcontroller: The ESP32 serves as the main control unit, handling RFID communication, user interface, and door control functions.
- RFID reader: An RFID reader module is integrated with the system to read the RFID tags on the dog collars.
- Manual override: In case of emergencies or power outages, a manual override mechanism allows the door to be opened manually from the inside or outside.
